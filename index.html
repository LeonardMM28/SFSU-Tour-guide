              your immunization records) on your student portal/gateway, you may

              i. This is where we get our student ID which also works as a
              clipper card for commuting. <br />&nbsp; 1. In San Francisco, MUNI
              is the main public transportation in the city. The MUNI train and
              busses take you all around the city! And what’s awesome about
              being a SF State student is that with your student ID card the
              MUNI is free! <br />&nbsp; 2. Your ID card also gets students 50%
              off BART (which is another public transportation option or the bay
              area) <br />
              ii. Can replace their student ID for $22. They will have to wait a
              few days (3-5) for their ID to function correctly for MUNI.
