                ii. If you have some holds (for example, if you forget to send
                in your immunization records) on your student portal/gateway,
                you may need to speak with them at this office.

                i. This is where we get our student ID which also works as a
                clipper card for commuting. <br />&nbsp; 1. In San Francisco,
                MUNI is the main public transportation in the city. The MUNI
                train and busses take you all around the city! And what’s
                awesome about being a SF State student is that with your student
                ID card the MUNI is free! <br />&nbsp; 2. Your ID card also gets
                students 50% off BART (which is another public transportation
                option or the bay area) <br />
                ii. Can replace their student ID for $22. They will have to wait
                a few days (3-5) for their ID to function correctly for MUNI.

                ii. Due to the impact on students and the small ratio of
                counselors to students, each student can have up to
                approximately six appointments per academic year. However, this
                number is flexible. <br />
